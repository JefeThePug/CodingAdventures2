    Hello out there. It's me — Captain Xarlos of the STS Solara. You were on her crew, right?
  </p>
  <p>
    The strangest thing has happened. One moment we were <a href="{{ url_for('main.release', year=2025) }}" target="_blank">
    stopping the Aurawroughts from breaking Eos out of her cosmic prison</a>, and the next, I find myself in
    this thick, eerie jungle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Something's wrong. I can't find the ship. I can't find the crew. I don't even know where — or even
    <span class="b">when</span> — we are.
  </p>
  <p>
    If this transmission reached you, the Solara's systems must have found a way to briefly link us across
    whatever world we've landed in. I don't understand it, but I do know one thing: your Python skills
    might be key to setting all of this ...whatever this is... right.
  </p>
  <p>
    Will you help me? I could use a partner. The universe isn't going to fix itself.
  </p>
