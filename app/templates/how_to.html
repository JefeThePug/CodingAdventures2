    <h2>Welcome to Practical Python Code Adventure</h2>
    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
      A ten-week-long event is held every year. For each week during these
      events, one challenge with two parts is released. In most cases, Part 1 is
      a bit easier, and Part 2 will either be a continuation of Part 1, a
      variation on the concept, or a similar concept in the same realm of
      problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each part has its own separate solutions and puzzle inputs, unless
      otherwise indicated.
    </p>
    <h3>Puzzle Inputs</h3>
    <p>
      Each challenge has at least one file that must be used to arrive at the
      correct solution. Usually, this is a text file, but other types of files
      may also be used. Additionally, there may be supplemental images to solve
      the puzzle which can also be downloaded. It is up to you to read this data
      into your own code for each challenge. For each required puzzle input, you
      will see text, indicating it can be downloaded, which looks like this...
    </p>
    <p class="main lg">[ click to get input ]</p>
    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    <p>
      This site offers no online IDE or Python Interpreter. You should write any
      code used to deduce the solutions on your own machine using the downloaded
      puzzle input files. Each challenge has exactly one correct solution for
      each of its two parts, which can be obtained using the puzzle input and
      implementing the correct algorithm hinted in the text of the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solutions will always be text and should be copied and pasted into the
      solution form on the site for submission. Make sure not to leave off any
      part of it. For Part 1, if the correct solution is submitted, you will
      immediately be able to view Part 2 of the challenge. For Part 2, if the
      correct solution is submitted, and you are logged in with Discord, you
      will be awarded a congratulatory screen with a link to the private
      discussion channel for that challenge in the Practical Python server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Practical Python also offers a public discussion channel for help if you
      are struggling with a challenge. However, please be fair to all and avoid
      posting the solutions to any challenges there. While there is no real
      penalty for cheating or sharing the answer, it does ruin the fun.
    </p>
    <h3>Progress</h3>
    <p>
      On the main page, your progress with the challenges is indicated using
      progress icons:
    </p>
    <p>
      {% for condition in ("off", "on") %}
      <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon {{ condition }}">
        {{ ICONS[year]["a-icon"] }}
      </span>
      <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon {{ condition }}">
        {{ ICONS[year]["b-icon"] }}
      </span>
      {% endfor %}
    </p>
    <p>
      These icons will light up when you have completed each part of the
      challenge:<br />the
      <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon on">
        {{ ICONS[year]["a-icon"] }}
      </span>
      {{ ICONS[year]["a-text"] }} for Part 1 and the
      <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon on">
        {{ ICONS[year]["b-icon"] }}
      </span>
      {{ ICONS[year]["b-text"] }} for Part 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are logged in with your Discord account, this progress is saved
      in a database. This allows you to keep your progress across multiple
      browsers and computers indefinitely. If you choose not to log into
      Discord, your progress is stored via browser cookies and cannot be carried
      over to a different browser. Additionally, your progress cannot be relied
      upon to remain for any amount of time, subject to your own cookie settings
      and this server's session. Plan ahead to remember the previously completed
      challenge solutions while using this site as a Guest account, in case you
      lose your progress.
